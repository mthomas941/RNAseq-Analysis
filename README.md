# RNAseq-Analysis
Gene Expression analysis for room temp and cold exposed mice with a focus on lipid metabolism.

This is an example RNAseq analysis to identify genes with the biggest differences between treatments.  One group of animals was cold exposed for 7 days, and the other group was kept at room temperature.  The raw RNAseq data was generated by BGI.

I've focused on lipid metabolism here as cold exposure markedly upregulates these pathways.
